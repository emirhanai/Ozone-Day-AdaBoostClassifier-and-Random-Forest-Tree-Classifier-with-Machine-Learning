# **Ozone Day AdaBoostClassifier and Random Forest Tree Classifier with Machine Learning**
I have developed 2 machine learning software that predict and classify ozone day and non ozone day. I upgraded and improved the accuracy values of one of these software. The data was unbalanced, and I painstakingly worked to reduce this imbalance. I created 2 classification software with 106 trees. One is the auxiliary classification and the other is the main classification. I am sharing the classification of 108 trees as .dot. Continuing mind-opening projects in the field of machine learning!

_Example:_ `model_ozone = ensemble.AdaBoostClassifier(base_estimator=None,
                                          n_estimators=109,
                                          learning_rate=1.549999999999978,
                                          algorithm='SAMME.R', )`
